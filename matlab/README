Maybe the hdf5 library that ships with a distribution does not include the C++ interfaces as default.

In such a case you have to download, configure, and compile the hdf5 libraries yourself with

cd /usr/src
apt-get source libhdf5-serial-dev
cd hdf5-1.8.4-patch1
./configure --prefix=/usr/local --enable-cxx 
nice make -j3
nice make check
make install
